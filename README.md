!!!!! Beware these are beginner level projects. Therefore may contain trash level code which can be harmful to your eyes and your brain !!!!!

There are two projects contained in the repository.

1) NavigationDemo :- Contains initial implementation of Navigation, FlatList, Custom Components etc.
2) APITest :- Contains the initial implementation of Fetch API usage to make GET and POST requests.
3) APITest_V2 :- Added because APITest suddenly stopped working on my machine.
